# h5p-dictation
Let your students train their listening comprehension and spelling.

You can e.g. upload sound samples that contain a recording of someone reading a sentence. Students can play these sound samples (n times) and enter what they hear.

## Ideas to think about ...
- Scoring: How to sensibly relate the number if mistakes or mistakes/words to scoring in H5P?
- Scoring: Distinguishing typos from "real" mistakes is simple, so the could be optionally be penalized differently. Also, it's possible to indicate what was wrong, e.g. "You have a typo in your solution" or "You forgot a word".
- Visualization: How to best visualize the solution? (already coded something that resembles the "suggestion mode" in GoogleDocs) Where?
- How to deal with punctuation? Simple: ignore. Nicer: make optional. Could also be relevant for feedback (spelling or punctuation).
- Adding an option for a second sample with "slow reading" might be interesting. Will most likely require some changes in H5P. Audio though (ability to change play button symbol to a snail or turtle (ideally SVG instead of font), maybe it's also possible to change the playback rate directly).
- Could be interesting, but the use case might be rather particular for this content type: Audio Recorder Widget which would allow to record the reading directly from within H5P.
- What's the best interaction type in xAPI?
